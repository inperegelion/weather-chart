# Weather Chart

You looking at my test task. Below you will find table of features implemented in the code base.

### Branches comparison

This comparison built by requirements document. Branch `no-ts-no-redux` built on regular JS with the Context as global state. But since one of requirements was to use Redux, I developed second branch `adding-redux` merged in `main` for you. Can't wait to hear your feedback. :)
